//! Agent names — human-memorable shortcuts that resolve to DIDs.
//!
//! An agent name is a URL whose path begins with `/@`
//! (`example.com/@alice`). It is **not** a DID method; it is a shortcut layer
//! in front of DID resolution. Resolution is three stages and the third is
//! mandatory:
//!
//! 1. the name URL redirects to a DID,
//! 2. the DID resolves to a document,
//! 3. **the document must claim the name back via `alsoKnownAs`.**
//!
//! Stage 1 is served by the name's own web server, so on its own it proves
//! nothing — anyone can publish a redirect at somebody else's DID. Stage 3 is
//! what makes the binding real: only the DID's controller can add an
//! `alsoKnownAs` entry. This module never surfaces a name that has not
//! completed all three, so a hostile DID cannot make the UI display it under a
//! name it does not actually own.
//!
//! All parsing, canonicalisation and `alsoKnownAs` matching delegates to the
//! [`agent_names`] crate. Canonicalisation is unspecified by the agent-name
//! spec, so two implementations that normalise differently disagree about
//! whether a name verifies — hand-rolling any of it is how the two sides drift.
//! This is the same rule the crate states for `didwebvh-rs`.
