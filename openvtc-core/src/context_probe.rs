//! Ask a Trust Context what is already in it, before setup writes to it.
//!
//! # Why setup asks
//!
//! Setup takes a VTA DID and a context id, authenticates, and starts creating
//! things. It has never checked whether that context already contains an
//! account — so pointing a fresh install at a context you already use silently
//! mints a *second* set of personas alongside the first, and pointing it at a
//! colleague's context is indistinguishable from a typo until much later.
//!
//! The moment setup holds an authenticated client it can simply look. Three
//! list calls answer it, and all three already exist — no VTA change (D5, D6).
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not rebuild anything. Recovering an existing context needs the
//! rebuild path (§6 of the spec) and the application-state store behind it;
//! until those land, knowing the context is occupied is itself the useful
//! answer, because it is the difference between a deliberate choice and a
//! silent collision.
//!
//! Every call is best-effort. A VTA that refuses one of these listings, or a
//! context the caller cannot enumerate, yields an [`Unknown`](ProbeOutcome)
//! rather than blocking setup: the probe exists to inform a decision, and
//! failing to inform it must not prevent making it.
