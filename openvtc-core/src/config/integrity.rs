//! What could not be loaded, and why — so a partial profile still starts.
//!
//! # The failure this exists for
//!
//! A profile is persisted in two writes, not one: [`Config::save`] writes the
//! public config file (carrying the encrypted account, and with it the persona
//! records) and *then* writes the `SecuredConfig` blob (carrying `key_info`,
//! which maps each DID verification method to its key) to the OS credential
//! store. They are not atomic. A crash, a full disk, or a credential store that
//! refuses the second write leaves a persona recorded in the account with no
//! key material recorded for it.
//!
//! Until now that was **fatal for the entire profile**: key rehydration
//! returned `Err` on the first verification method it could not find, the error
//! propagated out of the persona loop, and the whole load failed. One
//! half-written persona took down every other persona, every community, and
//! every relationship in the account — and the message named a verification
//! method id, which tells the user nothing about what to do.
//!
//! The rule now is that **a fault is isolated to the persona that has it**.
//! Everything that can be loaded is loaded, what cannot is recorded here, and
//! the user is shown this report and must acknowledge it before continuing.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not do
//!
//! It does not repair, and it does not delete. A degraded persona's record
//! stays in the account exactly as it was: it is skipped for this session, not
//! removed. Quietly dropping it would turn a recoverable inconsistency —
//! `key_info` may still be present in a backup, or the persona's keys may still
//! be at the VTA — into permanent loss, on the one code path taken by a user
//! whose profile is already damaged.
