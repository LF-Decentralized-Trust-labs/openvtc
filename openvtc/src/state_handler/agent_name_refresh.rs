//! Off-loop batch resolution of agent names.
//!
//! The runtime loop collects the DIDs whose names are uncached or stale
//! ([`Config::agent_name_refresh_targets`](openvtc_core::config::Config::agent_name_refresh_targets))
//! and hands the whole list to [`resolve_batch`] as a single background job. One
//! job (not one per DID) because the background-dispatch busy-guard is
//! per-domain: per-DID jobs on the shared `AgentName` domain would serialise.
//!
//! Inside the job the DIDs resolve concurrently but **bounded** — a sliding
//! window of at most [`CONCURRENCY`] in flight — so a large account does not
//! open an unbounded fan of connections at the resolver (VTI R1.4). The job does
//! I/O only; its `(did, name)` results are applied to the config on the loop
//! thread by `background_dispatch::apply_outcome`, preserving the single-mutator
//! invariant.

// The resolver type, re-exported by the TDK facade so this crate needs no
// direct dependency on the cache SDK.
