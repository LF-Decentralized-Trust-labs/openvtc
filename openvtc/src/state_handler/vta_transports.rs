//! Off-loop probe of the transports a VTA advertises.
//!
//! The VTA panel used to show a bare `VTA URL`, which says nothing about *how*
//! the CLI is talking to the VTA — the URL stays populated on the DIDComm path
//! too, where it is only the REST fallback. What the operator needs is the pair
//! "what does this VTA offer" / "which one are we on".
//!
//! The second half is free (see
//! [`VtaTransports::in_use`](crate::state_handler::main_page::content::VtaTransports::in_use)).
//! The first needs the VTA's DID document resolved, so it runs here as a
//! background job on its own dispatch domain and is applied to the panel state
//! on the loop thread, preserving the single-mutator invariant.
//!
//! The endpoint extraction is **not** hand-rolled: `vta_sdk`'s
//! `provision_client::resolve_vta` already reads the `#vta-rest` and
//! `DIDCommMessaging` services out of the document, and the setup flow calls the
//! same function — so the panel and the bootstrap diagnostics can never disagree
//! about what a VTA advertises.
